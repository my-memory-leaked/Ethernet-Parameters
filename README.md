# Ethernet Parameters
The Ethernet parameters play a crucial role in establishing network connectivity and facilitating communication between devices. This code aims to provide a clear understanding of these parameters and their significance within the project.

I didn't use inheritance in the project because when I need libraries, I take individual files!

# Introduction
Ethernet is a widely used networking technology that enables devices to connect and communicate within a local area network (LAN). In this project, Ethernet parameters are utilized to store in memory and configure network settings used in network connections.

# IPv4 Address
The IPv4 address is a 32-bit numerical identifier assigned to each device connected to a network. It serves as a unique identifier for the device and allows it to send and receive data over an IPv4-based network. The IPv4 address is typically represented in dot-decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.0.1), where each octet represents 8 bits of the address.
